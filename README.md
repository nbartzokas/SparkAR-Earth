The world is your game board! Run around a beautifully rendered planet Earth. Aim at countries you're challenged to identify. Do it all before the clock runs out to prove how well you know your world!

## Inspiration

I'm inspired by games that teach through gameplay. There are some fun, simple geography games out there. I like to challenge myself with them from time to time. It's so easy to forget where a country is when you aren't exposed to it's name very often. And when you forget where a country is, you lose so much context since the bordering countries are culturally related. Geography is a foundational knowledge that helps build a better understanding of our diverse world.

## What it does

In this game you're given a timed challenge to find countries in the world. A realistic planet Earth hovers above the floor in front of you. As you move around it, aiming your camera at its surface, countries light up below your cursor.

## How I built it

I'm also a big fan of using NASA's beautiful imagery of the world. They provide

## Challenges I ran into

didn't have a countries object, so used a texture
how to freeze a signal value

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

the earth

## What I learned

Through completing this project I learned more about:

- Advanced 3D rendering techniques in Spark AR
- Patches, Reactive programming, and how to bridge the two
- Organization, algorithms, and game design patterns in Spark AR Studio
- Incorporating 3rd party libraries like d3.js
- 2D UI animation techniques
- Effective debugging in Spark AR

## What's next?

I'm not sure what I'll tackle next, but there's room for:

- [ ] The ability to record and share a video of your victory!
- [ ] Translation into other languages
- [ ] Difficulty adjustments, especially a better strategy for aiming at small countries.
- [ ] Data cleanup. There are some issues with the country data I'd like to fix.
- [ ] Having people start off pointing at the country where they live.
- [ ] Design upgrades, organization, applying more of what I learned along the way.
